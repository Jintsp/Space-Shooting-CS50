#### Description:

This is my final CS50 project call Space Shooter. In this project the aim of the game is to destroy the enemies space craft and climb up the level ladders as much as possible. There is only one file in this project which include all the program for both the enemies and the player space craft. But before I explained the programming syntax. I just want to give a special metioned to Tech with Tim who help me completed this propject as well as providing me with the image for the play and enemies air craft as well as the picture for the laser.

So in the Beginning of the code I am inputting the picture of the aircraft of the enemies, player and laser. And after I defined a class for the laser for the location of it and how should it be moving up or down depending of the space craft so if its the player the laser will move upward when the player press a button, however if it is from the enemies it will shoot out the laser randomly.

After the laser class I defined a ship class. This Ship class is meant for the enemies aircraft so the idea of this is that the enemies will not just pop out randomly, but actually it is hiding behind the frame of the game and slowly moving towards the player. Additionally after making the enemies aircraft I create a class for the player ship which in the code includes the health bar of the player.

Further from the object I also create a class for the collision of the player's ship and the enemies ship. So everytime the player collied with the enemies the health bar will also decrease.
